🩺 Medical Image Analysis App using GPT-4o
This project is a Streamlit web application that leverages OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini model to analyze medical images and provide detailed insights about potential anomalies, diseases, or health issues. The app allows users to upload medical images (X-rays, MRIs, scans, etc.), and the model generates a comprehensive analysis report, including findings, next steps, and recommendations.

🚀 Features
Medical Image Analysis – Upload medical images to get AI-generated insights and anomaly detection.
Explain Like I'm 5 (ELI5) – Break down complex medical terminology into simpler language for easier understanding.
Dynamic Image Handling – Supports .jpg, .jpeg, and .png file formats.
Secure and Temporary – Uploaded images are processed temporarily and deleted immediately after analysis.
User-Friendly Interface – Built with Streamlit for fast deployment and simple UI/UX.
🛠️ Technologies Used
Python – Backend and API handling.
Streamlit – Web framework for building interactive UI.
OpenAI GPT-4o-mini – Image and text analysis.
Tempfile – Secure temporary file handling.
Base64 – Image encoding for GPT model input.
Dotenv – For managing API keys securely.
